      <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, a company
        best known for its high-end Unix workstations. Modeled after C++, the Java language was
        designed to be small, simple, and portable across platforms and operating systems, both at the
        source and at the binary level.</p>
      <p>Here are some advantages of Java:
      <ol>
        <li>Java is platform-independent.</li>
        <li>Java is object-oriented.</li>
        <li>Java is Easy to Learn.</li>
      </ol>

      <header>Objects and Classes</header>
      <p>A class is a template for multiple objects with similar features. Classes embody all the
        features of a particular set of objects.
        When you write a program in an object-oriented language, you don’t define actual objects. You
        define classes of objects.
        <br>An instance of a class is another word for an actual object. If classes are an abstract
        representation of an object, an instance is its concrete representation.
        We start with a basic class definition by opening up the editor and entering the following:<br>
        <code>class Motorcycle {
          }</code><br>
        Now,we create some instance variables for this class—three of them, to be specific.<br>
        <code>
          String make;<br>
          String color;<br>
          boolean engineState;
        </code>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Behavior" class="main-section">
      <header>Behavior</header>
      <p>A class’s behavior determines what instances of that class do when their internal state changes
        or when that instance is asked to do something by another class or object. Behavior is the way
        objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them.</p>
      <p>To define an object’s behavior, you create methods, which look and behave just like functions
        in other languages, but are defined inside a class. Java does not have functions defined outside
        classes.<br>
        Methods are functions defined inside classes that operate on instances of those classes.<br>
        Now let’s add some behavior (methods) to the class. There are all kinds of things a motorcycle
        can do, but to keep things short, let’s add just one method—a method that starts the engine.<br>
        <code>void startEngine() {
          if (engineState == true)<br>
          System.out.println(“The engine is already on.”);<br>
          else {<br>
          engineState = true;<br>
          System.out.println(“The engine is now on.”);<br>
          }<br>
          }<br></code>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Expressions_and_Operators" class="main-section">
      <header>Expressions and Operators</header>
      <p>Expressions are statements that return a value.<br>Arithmetic and tests for equality and magnitude are common examples of expressions. Because
        they return a value, you can assign that result to a variable or test that value in other Java
        statements.</p>
      <p> Operators are special symbols that are commonly used in expressions.<br>Operators in Java include arithmetic, various forms of assignment, increment and decrement,
        and logical operations. This section describes all these things.</p>

      <p>Here are some examples of expressions and operators:<br>
        <code>class ArithmeticTest {<br>
          public static void main (String[] args) {<br>
          short x = 6;<br>
          int y = 4;<br>
          float a = 12.5f;<br>
          float b = 7f;<br>
          System.out.println(“x is “ + x + “, y is “ + y);<br>
          System.out.println(“x + y = “ + (x + y));<br>
          System.out.println(“x - y = “ + (x - y));<br>
          System.out.println(“x / y = “ + (x / y));<br>
          System.out.println(“x % y = “ + (x % y));<br>
          System.out.println(“a is “ + a + “, b is “ + b;<br>
          System.out.println(“a / b = “ + (a / b));</code>
      </p>
      <p>The output for the above code is:<br>
        <code>x is 6, y is 4<br>
          x + y = 10<br>
          x - y = 2<br>
          x / y = 1<br>
          x % y = 2<br>
          a is 12.5, b is 7<br>
          a / b = 1.78571</code>
